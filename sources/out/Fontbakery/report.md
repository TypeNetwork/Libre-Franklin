<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.

If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font
Bakery could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure
call (rpc).

There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/master/prebuilt/workarounds/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Check if the vertical metrics of a family are similar to the same family hosted on Google Fonts.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vertical_metrics_regressions](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vertical_metrics_regressions)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

If the family already exists on Google Fonts, we need to ensure that the
checked family&#x27;s vertical metrics are similar. This check will test the
following schema which was outlined in Fontbakery issue #1162 [1]:

- The family should visually have the same vertical metrics as the
  Regular style hosted on Google Fonts.
- If the family on Google Fonts has differing hhea and typo metrics,
  the family being checked should use the typo metrics for both the
  hhea and typo entries.
- If the family on Google Fonts has use typo metrics not enabled and the
  family being checked has it enabled, the hhea and typo metrics
  should use the family on Google Fonts winAscent and winDescent values.
- If the upms differ, the values must be scaled so the visual appearance
  is the same.

* ‚ö† **WARN** Thin Italic:100 is OK on TTFs, but OTF files with those values will cause bluring on Windows. GlyphsApp users must set an Instance Custom Parameter for the Thin and ExtraLight styles to 250 and 275, so that if OTFs are exported then it will not blur on Windows. [code: blur-on-windows]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Stricter unitsPerEm criteria for Google Fonts. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Even though the OpenType spec allows unitsPerEm to be any value between 16 and
16384, the Google Fonts project aims at a narrower set of reasonable values.

The spec suggests usage of powers of two in order to get some performance
improvements on legacy renderers, so those values are acceptable.

But value of 500 or 1000 are also acceptable, with the added benefit that it
makes upm math easier for designers, while the performance hit of not using a
power of two is most likely negligible nowadays.

Another acceptable value is 2000. Since TT outlines are all integers (no
floats), then instances in a VF suffer rounding compromises, and therefore a
1000 UPM is to small because it forces too many such compromises.

Therefore 2000 is a good &#x27;new VF standard&#x27;, because 2000 is a simple 2x
conversion from existing fonts drawn on a 1000 UPM, and anyone who knows what
10 units can do for 1000 UPM will know what 20 units does too.

Additionally, values above 2048 would result in filesize increases with not
much added benefit.


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** Even though unitsPerEm (1000) in this font is reasonable. It is strongly advised to consider changing it to 2000, since it will likely improve the quality of Variable Fonts by avoiding excessive rounding of coordinates on interpolations. [code: legacy-value]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).


</pre>

	- f + i
